Test your memory skills! Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison.

## How to play
1. Watch the Lights: Simon will flash a series of colored lights.
2. Memorize the Sequence: Remember the order of the lights.
3. Repeat the Sequence: Press the colored buttons in the same order Simon showed.
4. Keep Going: The game progressively gets harder by adding more lights to the sequence.
6. Each color has its own unique sound! Try each of the buttons before starting the game to get familiar with their sounds.

My record is 23!
