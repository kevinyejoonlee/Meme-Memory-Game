Test your memory skills ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ ! Simon says is a game that we all grew up playing. This is based on that game. Simon will play a series of memes and you must follow him ğŸ•º.

## How to play
1. Watch the Lights: Meme-Memory will flash a series of memes.
2. Memorize the Sequence: Remember the order of the lights.
3. Repeat the Sequence: Press the meme buttons in the same order Meme-Memory showed.
4. Keep Going: The game progressively gets harder by adding more memes to the sequence.
6.  Try each of the buttons before starting the game to get familiar with their sounds!

My record is 23!
